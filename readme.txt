== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Manage your CM Answers from Left Side Admin Menu

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the JS plugin files to work properly.  If your theme does not support this you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize look&feel? =
In your template create a directory "CMA". Inside you can place a structure similar to the one inside "cm-answers/views/frontend/". If the file can be found in your template directory, then it will have a priority. Otherwise, the default from plugin directory will be used.
