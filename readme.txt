== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Manage your CM Answers plugin from Left Side Admin Dashboard

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the JS plugin files to work properly.  If your theme does not support this you will need to link them files manually in your theme (not recommended).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize the look & feel of the plugin? =
In your template you can custom create a directory called "CMA". Inside this directory you can place a structure that is similar to the one inside "cm-answers/views/frontend/". If the file is properly able to be found in your template's directory, then it will have priority over the default. Otherwise, the default file from our plugin directory will be used.
